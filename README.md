# PRODIGY_ML_02
I have implemented a K-Means clustering algorithm based on Task-02: "Create a K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history." K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group similar data points into clusters. The goal is to partition the dataset into distinct groups (clusters) where data points within each group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.

# Dataset
Here is the dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python

# Steps for using the dataset
1. Download the file from the website
2. Upload them to your drive in a folder called Datasets to make things easier.
3. Then open Google Colab
4. Add a Code cell above the given code in the ipynb file to mount your Google drive.

# Code Execution
The code is inside the Customer_Segmentation.ipynb file. Do the above steps and then execute the code given . The Mall_Customers csv file is used here.

# Knowledge Gained
In this task, I learned how to apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their purchase history. I gained insights into how to select appropriate features for clustering and how to determine the optimal number of clusters. Additionally, I learned how to visualize clustering results using scatter plots and how to interpret the clustering outcomes to understand customer segments better. This task also enhanced my understanding of unsupervised learning techniques in machine learning.

**1. Understanding K-Means Clustering:** I learned how the K-Means algorithm functions by iteratively assigning data points to clusters based on their similarity and updating the centroids to minimize within-cluster variance. This enhanced my grasp of unsupervised learning, particularly how K-Means identifies patterns without labeled data.

**2. Feature Selection and Preprocessing:** I gained insights into selecting relevant features (e.g., annual income, spending score) that significantly impact clustering results. This task also reinforced the importance of data preprocessing, including scaling and normalization, to ensure effective clustering.

**3. Optimal Cluster Determination:** I explored methods like the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K). Understanding this concept was crucial in balancing model complexity with accuracy, ensuring meaningful customer segments.

**4. Visualization and Interpretation:** I learned to visualize clustering results using scatter plots, which helped me interpret the distinct customer groups formed by K-Means. This visual analysis provided a clearer understanding of customer segmentation in retail.

**5. Practical Implementation with Python:** The task strengthened my practical skills in implementing K-Means using Pythonâ€™s 'scikit-learn' library. I also improved my ability to evaluate clustering performance through metrics and visualize data, contributing to a deeper understanding of customer behavior analysis.
