# PRODIGY_ML_02
I have implemented a K-Means clustering algorithm based on Task-02: "Create a K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history." K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group similar data points into clusters. The goal is to partition the dataset into distinct groups (clusters) where data points within each group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.

# Dataset
Here is the dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python
