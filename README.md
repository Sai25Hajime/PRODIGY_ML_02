# PRODIGY_ML_02
I have implemented a K-Means clustering algorithm based on Task-02: "Create a K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history." K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group similar data points into clusters. The goal is to partition the dataset into distinct groups (clusters) where data points within each group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.

# Dataset
Here is the dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python

# Steps for using the dataset
1. Download the file from the website
2. Upload them to your drive in a folder called Datasets to make things easier.
3. Then open Google Colab
4. Add a Code cell above the given code in the ipynb file to mount your Google drive.
